# Welcone to Plant-Mood-Matcher
This is the source code for a website that I made which directly matches your mood and age with a specific plant!
This websie is hosted on github pages!
To use the website you have to enter your age and emotion at the time of input! Based on these inputs the website will then match you with a plant!

# AI declaration
There is NO AI that used in the code of the website, readme, My devlogs, image generation and this README
HOWEVER, I have used AI to find and match plants based on the inputs of the user, However I have not USED AI to generate images of these plants, THESE are all STOCK images found on Google!
